# Peer Graded Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This document is for Shiny project. 


The theme is ‘Calculation the Number of Samples’. You can get the number of minimum samples with confidence level and maximum error rate. 

If you want to know how many people you should survey, you just input the confidence level and maximum error rate. 
For example, you want to know the number under 95% confidence level and with 5% error rate, you just choose 95% on ‘Confidence Level’ and input 5 on ‘Numeric input, Maximum error(%)’. Please be careful input as integer. Then, you can get the number, 384.16. Your should survey 385 samples at least.
